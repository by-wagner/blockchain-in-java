Reference types can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to methods, and returned as values from methods. They are important for creating complex, object-oriented programs in Java. Unlike primitive types, which store their values directly, reference types store a reference to an object. When comparing reference types using the == operator, it compares the references (memory addresses) rather than the actual values. Additionally, assigning one value of a reference variable to another creates a copy of the reference, rather than the value itself. Reference types can also refer to a special value that represents the fact that it is not initialized yet or does not have a value. It is important to note that in Java, the heap is the region of memory where objects are stored and allocated dynamically during runtime.">reference types</a>. For example, to work with integers, it's possible to create <code class="language-java">Stream&lt;Integer&gt;</code> that wraps primitive <code class="language-java">int</code>'s into the <code class="language-java">Integer</code> class. But this is not an efficient way to work with integers since it needs additional wrapper objects. Fortunately, there are three primitive specialized types called <code class="language-java">IntStream</code>, <code class="language-java">LongStream</code>, and <code class="language-java">DoubleStream</code> which can effectively process primitive values without extra boxing.</p>

<h5 id="creating-primitive-type-streams">Creating primitive-type streams</h5>
<p>There are lots of ways to create <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/8407" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a primitive-type stream is a type of stream that is specifically designed to handle primitive data types such as int, double, and boolean, without the need for object wrappers. | This is more memory-efficient than using the generic stream, which always represents objects by reference type. Primitive-type streams can be created in several ways, such as passing elements in the stream() method or creating an empty stream. They are particularly useful when working with large data sets, as they can reduce the overhead of creating and managing object wrappers.">primitive-type streams</a>. Some of the ways are suitable for all streams while others are not.</p>
<ul><li><p>Passing elements in the <code class="language-java">of</code> method:</p></li></ul>
<pre><code class="language-java">IntStream ints = IntStream.of(1, 2, 3);
LongStream longs = LongStream.of(1, 2, 3);
DoubleStream doubles = DoubleStream.of(12.2, 18.1);</code></pre>
<p>This looks quite similar to collections. It is also possible to create an empty stream invoking <code class="language-java">IntStream.of()</code> or <code class="language-java">IntStream.empty()</code>.</p>
<ul><li><p>From an array of primitives:</p></li></ul>
<pre><code class="language-java">IntStream numbers = Arrays.stream(new int[]{1, 2, 3});</code></pre>
<p>This way works for all types of primitive specialized streams. It is also possible to specify <code class="language-java">start</code> (inclusive) and <code class="language-java">end</code> (exclusive) positions to create a stream only from a subarray.</p>
<ul><li><p>For <code class="language-java">IntStream</code> and <code class="language-java">LongStream</code> it's possible to invoke <code class="language-java">range()</code> and <code class="language-java">rangeClosed()</code> to create streams from <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/8407" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a range refers to a sequence of values between a lower and upper boundary, including both. | This concept is often used in the context of generating random numbers within a specific range or defining character sets using regular expressions. For example, you can specify a range of characters in a set using the dash symbol, where the character before the dash denotes the starting point and the character after it is the last character within the range. This is particularly useful when defining alphabetically ordered letters and numeric values.">ranges</a>.</p></li></ul>
<pre><code class="language-java">IntStream numbers = IntStream.range(10, 15); // from 10 (incl) to 15 (excl)
LongStream longs = LongStream.rangeClosed(1_000_000, 2_000_000); // it includes both borders</code></pre>
<p>The difference is the method <code class="language-java">rangeClosed</code> includes its upper bound while <code class="language-java">range</code> does not.</p>
<ul><li><p>Getting <code class="language-java">IntStream</code> from a string:</p></li></ul>
<pre><code class="language-java">IntStream stream = "aibohphobia".chars(); // It returns an IntStream!</code></pre>
<p>This only works for <code class="language-java">IntStream</code> since characters can be represented as <code class="language-java">int</code>'s.</p>
<p>Other ways to create <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/8407" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a primitive type is one of eight built-in data types provided by the language. | They are represented by keywords and are not objects, unlike reference types. Primitive types are divided into groups based on their meaning, and each group operates similarly but has different sizes and ranges of value. The most commonly used primitive type is `int`, which represents an integer number. Java also provides several types for integer and fractional numbers, which are often used in arithmetic expressions. Primitive types store their value directly, unlike reference types that store a reference to an object located elsewhere.">primitive type</a> streams are the same as for generic streams: <code class="language-java">generate</code>, <code class="language-java">iterate</code>, <code class="language-java">concat</code> and so on. Here is an example of generating <code class="language-java">DoubleStream</code> with ten random numbers and printing them:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">DoubleStream.generate(Math::random)
        .limit(10)
        .forEach(System.out::println);</code></pre>
<p>Now let's look at some operations with primitive streams.</p>
<h5 id="additional-operations">Additional operations</h5>
<p>The primitive streams have all the same methods as generic streams, but their methods accept primitive specialized functions as arguments. For example, the <code class="language-java">forEach</code> method of <code class="language-java">IntStream</code> takes <code class="language-java">IntConsumer</code>, but not <code class="language-java">Consumer&lt;Integer&gt;</code>. Fortunately, this does not affect the possibilities of the streams.</p>
<p>There are a few additional aggregating operations such as <code class="language-java">min</code>, <code class="language-java">max</code>, <code class="language-java">average</code> and <code class="language-java">sum</code>. The first three return an optional object which represents a result or nothing since the initial stream can be empty.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary"><p>Note, actually <code class="language-java">Stream&lt;T&gt;</code> also provides <code class="language-java">min</code> and <code class="language-java">max</code> but its methods need a comparator as the argument.</p></div>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The following code demonstrates the methods:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int[] numbers = { 10, 11, 25, 14, 22, 21, 18 };

int max = IntStream.of(numbers).max().getAsInt();
System.out.println(max); // 25

int min = IntStream.of(numbers).min().getAsInt();
System.out.println(min); // 10

double avg = IntStream.of(numbers).average().orElse(0.0);
System.out.println(avg); // 17.2857...

int sum = IntStream.of(numbers).sum();
System.out.println(sum); // 121</code></pre>
<p>It is also possible to calculate these aggregates at once using a single invocation of the <code class="language-java">summaryStatistics</code> method.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">IntSummaryStatistics stat = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 55_555).summaryStatistics();

System.out.println(String.format("Count: %d, Min: %d, Max: %d, Avg: %.1f",
        stat.getCount(), stat.getMin(), stat.getMax(), stat.getAverage()));</code></pre>
<p>Here are the results:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Count: 55555, Min: 1, Max: 55555, Avg: 27778.0</code></pre>
<p>Wow! And no loops here.</p>
<h5 id="transforming-streams">Transforming streams</h5>
<p>You can perform various transformations to primitive-type streams.</p>
<ul><li><p><strong> Transforming a primitive type stream to another one</strong> using <code class="language-java">asDoubleStream()</code> for <code class="language-java">IntStream</code> and <code class="language-java">LongStream</code>, or <code class="language-java">asLongStream()</code> for <code class="language-java">IntStream</code> only.</p></li></ul>
<p>Here is an example that converts a stream of integers into a stream of doubles:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">IntStream.of(1, 2, 3, 4)
        .asDoubleStream()
        .forEach(System.out::println); // it prints doubles 1.0, 2.0, ...</code></pre>
<ul><li><p><strong>Transforming a primitive-type stream into a generalized stream</strong> using the <code class="language-java">boxed()</code> method (i.e., <code class="language-java">IntStream</code> → <code class="language-java">Stream&lt;Integer&gt;</code>). All the primitive-type streams have this.</p></li></ul>
<pre><code class="language-java">Stream&lt;Integer&gt; streamOfNumbers = IntStream.range(1, 10).boxed();</code></pre>
<ul><li><p><strong>Transforming a generalized stream into a stream of primitives</strong> can be done by invoking one of the <code class="language-java">mapToInt()</code>, <code class="language-java">mapToLong()</code> or <code class="language-java">mapToDouble()</code> methods with the <code class="language-java">i -&gt; i</code> <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/8407" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a lambda expression is a function that is not bound to a name (an anonymous function) and can be assigned to a variable. | It consists of a list of parameters followed by the body that can return a value. Lambda expressions are often used to pass a block of code as data to a method. They allow for more readable and concise code, and can be used in place of method references. Lambda expressions have a special type, and there are several types of lambda expressions defined in the Java standard library, such as Function and Predicate, both located in the java.util.function package.">lambda expression</a> as the argument:</p></li></ul>
<pre><code class="language-java">List&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = List.of(1, 5, 9);
int sum = numbers.stream().mapToInt(i -&gt; i).sum(); // 15</code></pre>
<p>This can be especially useful when you want to invoke one of the primitive stream methods.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>We've considered three primitive specialized streams which are similar to the generalized stream but have some features:</p>
<ul><li><p>their methods take primitive specialized functions as arguments;</p></li><li><p>they have additional methods such as <code class="language-java">range</code>, <code class="language-java">sum</code>, <code class="language-java">average</code>, <code class="language-java">summaryStatistics</code> and some others;</p></li><li><p>they have performance benefits since there is no need to perform boxing/unboxing operations;</p></li><li><p>they can be converted to a generalized stream and vice versa.</p></li></ul>
