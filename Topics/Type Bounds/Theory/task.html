<h5 id="introduction">Introduction</h5>
<p>In previous articles, we have mentioned that generics can accept any type of parameter and make it possible to reuse some code. Let's now consider an example that will reveal another aspect of generics. Imagine that we have a generic <code class="language-java">Storage&lt;T&gt;</code> class that can contain objects of any class. But there are some situations in which we want to restrict these objects. We can say, for example, that the storage has to be able to contain only books. In these types of situations, we should use type bounds.</p>
<h5 id="usage">Usage</h5>
<p>Let us take a closer look at type bounds. Consider this code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class Storage&lt;T&gt; {
    private T nameOfElements;
    //other methods
}</code></pre>
<p>We can put any type of object inside <code class="language-java">Storage&lt;T&gt;</code>. As stated earlier, we would like to limit this class to be able to store only books. Let's assume we have a <code class="language-java">Books</code> class to represent all books. Then we can implement our limitation by adding  <code class="language-java">&lt;T extends Books&gt;</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class Storage&lt;T extends Books&gt; {
    private T nameOfElements;
    //other methods
}</code></pre>
<p>Let us create three classes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class Books { }
public class Brochures extends Books { }
public class Computers { }</code></pre>
<p>Now creating three <code class="language-java">Storage</code> objects will lead to different results:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Storage&lt;Books&gt; storage1 = new Storage&lt;&gt;(); //no problem
Storage&lt;Brochures&gt; storage2 = new Storage&lt;&gt;(); //no problem
Storage&lt;Computers&gt; storage3 = new Storage&lt;&gt;(); //a compile-time error</code></pre>
<p>The first two lines will compile without problems. The third one, however, will return an error: <code class="language-java">Type parameter 'Computers' is not within its bound; should extend Books.</code> Since this is a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/8216" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a compile-time error is a type of error that prevents a Java program from being compiled due to issues such as syntax errors, incorrect keyword usage, missing symbols, improper source code file names, invocation of non-existing methods, and other issues. | These errors are different from run-time errors, which occur during the execution of a program. Compile-time errors are typically easier to identify and fix because they prevent the program from compiling, while run-time errors may not be discovered until the program is running.">compile-time error</a>, we catch this problem before it can appear in a real application. For this reason, type bounds are safe to use. </p>

<div class="alert alert-primary"><p>Note that <code class="language-java">extends</code> can mean not only an extension of a certain class but also an implementation of an interface. Generally speaking, this word is used as a replacement for an extension of normal classes, not <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/8216" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a generic class is a class that is parameterized over a type, allowing it to handle different data types in a uniform manner. | The type parameter is specified within angle brackets following the class name, and it can be used within the class body for fields, method arguments, return values, and local variables. The concrete type is determined when an object of the class is created or a method is invoked.

This approach enables the writing of more abstract and reusable code, as the same class or method can process multiple types in the same way.">generic classes</a>. Trying to extend a generic class (for example, <code class="language-java">Storage&lt;Brochures&gt; extends Storage&lt;Books&gt;</code>) will lead to an error.</p></div>

<h5 id="principles">Principles</h5>
<p>Type bounding involves two keywords, "extends" and "super", each with their own rules regulating their utilization. In this topic, however, we deal with the most common use of type bounds: setting an upper bound with the "extends" keyword. We will learn more about the principles underlying these keywords in the "Wildcards" topic. </p>
<p>Note that under the hood, every <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/8216" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a type variable is a type parameter that is declared in a class or method and is used to represent a concrete type that will be specified when an instance of the class or method is created. | Type variables are used for fields, method arguments, return values, and local variables within the class. They allow for flexibility and reusability by enabling the creation of classes and methods that can process different types in the same way. Only reference types, such as arrays, standard classes, or custom classes, can be used as concrete types for generic type variables.">type variable</a> declared as a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/8216" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a type parameter is a placeholder for a specific type used in a class or method declaration. | It is defined within angle brackets following the class or method name. Once declared, a type parameter can be used within the class or method body as an ordinary type. The advantage of using type parameters is that they enable you to write more abstract code and develop reusable software libraries. At the time of creating an object of the class or invoking the method, a concrete type is determined for the type parameter.">type parameter</a> has a bound. If no bound is declared, <code class="language-java">Object</code> is the bound. For this reason,</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class SomeClass&lt;T&gt; {...}</code></pre>
<p>is equivalent to</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class SomeClass&lt;T extends Object&gt; {...}</code></pre>
<h5 id="multiple-bounds">Multiple bounds</h5>
<p>A type variable may have a single <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/8216" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a type bound is a constraint placed on a type parameter in a generic class or interface. | It specifies that the type parameter must be, at a minimum, a specific class or implement certain interfaces. This is used to restrict the types that can be used as arguments for the type parameter, ensuring type safety. A type bound can include both a class and one or more interfaces, with the class (if present) specified first. If no explicit bound is declared, then the default bound is the Object class.">type bound</a>: </p>
<pre><code class="language-java">&lt;T extends A&gt;</code></pre>
<p>or have multiple bounds:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">&lt;T extends A &amp; B &amp; C &amp; ...&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The first type bound ("A") can be a class or an interface. The rest of the type bounds ("B" onwards) must be interfaces.</p>
<p>Note: if <code class="language-java">T</code> has a bound that is a class, this class must be specified first! Otherwise, a compile-time error arises:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">&lt;T extends B &amp; C &amp; A &amp; ...&gt; //an error if A is a class</code></pre>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>Type bounds are widely used to restrict type parameters. The most common use of type bounds is to set upper bounds with the <code class="language-java">extends</code> keyword. Certain situations, however, require the use of wildcards, a topic closely related to type bounds. You will learn about wildcards in the next article.</p>
